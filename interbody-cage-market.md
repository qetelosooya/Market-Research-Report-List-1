<p><p>An interbody cage is a medical device used in spinal surgeries to stabilize and support the intervertebral discs. These cages are typically made from materials like titanium or polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and are inserted between vertebrae to promote fusion by providing a space for bone growth. They play a critical role in the treatment of conditions such as degenerative disc disease, spinal deformities, and trauma.</p><p>The interbody cage market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by an increasing prevalence of spinal disorders and an aging population that demands advanced surgical interventions. Advancements in technology have led to the development of innovative designs, such as expandable and bioactive cages, enhancing their efficiency and patient outcomes. </p><p>Additionally, a growing preference for minimally invasive surgical techniques is expected to further propel the market, as interbody cages are often essential in such procedures. The rise in healthcare expenditure and improved reimbursement policies are also contributing factors. Overall, the interbody cage market shows significant potential, reflecting an upward trend aligned with the evolving landscape of spinal surgery.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interbody Cage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Type</li><li>Polymeric Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The interbody cage market is categorized into two main types: metal and polymeric. Metal cages, often made from titanium or stainless steel, provide strength and durability, facilitating spinal stability and load-bearing support. They are preferred for their biocompatibility and resistance to wear. In contrast, polymeric cages, typically constructed from materials like PEEK, offer flexibility, reduced radiopacity, and enhanced integration with surrounding bone. Both types serve to maintain disc space during spinal fusion procedures, with choices depending on specific clinical needs and patient preferences.</p></p>
