<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrapartum Monitoring Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fetal Scalp Electrodes</li><li>Intrauterine Pressure Catheter</li><li>Transducer for FHR</li><li>Transducer for Uterine Contractions</li><li>Monitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intrapartum monitoring devices are essential for assessing fetal and maternal health during labor. Fetal scalp electrodes directly measure the fetal heart rate (FHR) by attaching to the baby's scalp, providing continuous data. Intrauterine pressure catheters gauge intrauterine pressure to determine contraction strength. Transducers for FHR utilize non-invasive techniques to track fetal heart rate externally, while transducers for uterine contractions monitor the frequency and intensity of contractions. Together, these devices enhance clinical decision-making and ensure safer labor outcomes.</p></p>
