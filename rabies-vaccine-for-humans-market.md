<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rabies Vaccine for Humans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preventative Vaccine</li><li>Emergency Rabies Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rabies vaccine market for humans is divided into two main types: preventative vaccines and emergency rabies vaccines. Preventative vaccines are administered to individuals at risk, such as those working with animals or traveling to endemic areas, to provide long-term immunity against the virus. Emergency rabies vaccines are given post-exposure, usually after a bite from a potentially rabid animal, to prevent the onset of the disease. Both types are essential in controlling rabies and ensuring public health safety.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Rabies Vaccine for Humans Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-exposure prophylaxis</li><li>Post-exposure prophylaxis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The human rabies vaccine market primarily serves two applications: pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PrEP is administered to individuals at high risk of rabies exposure, such as veterinarians and animal handlers, enhancing their immunity before potential contact with the virus. In contrast, PEP is critical for individuals who have already been exposed to rabies, involving a series of vaccinations to prevent the onset of the disease. Both applications are essential for rabies prevention and control.</p></p>
